===========

Homework repository for the gazebo simulation seminar


Notes
=======
Because i'am using gazebo that is shipped by ROS, i've tested everything using different commands:

Start Gazebo:
```
rosrun gazebo gazebo'
```
and 
```
rosrun gazebo gui
``` in another terminal

Load a world: 
```
rosrun gazebo gazebo $absolute_path_to_repo/homework1/worlds/homework1.sdf
```
